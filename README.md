## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard contains visualizations that help explore and interpret energy consumption metrics by time and variables such as:

- **Global Active Power (kilowatts)**: The total power consumption used by the household.
- **Global Reactive Power (kilowatts)**: A measure of non-working power.
- **Voltage (volts)**: Represents the average voltage.
- **Sub-metering (1, 2, 3)**:
  - **Sub-metering 1**: Kitchen (dishwasher, oven, microwave).
  - **Sub-metering 2**: Laundry room appliances.
  - **Sub-metering 3**: Water heater and air-conditioning.

## 📅 Time Period

The data covers December 2006 to November 2010 with minute-level readings.
